# End-to-End ML Pipeline for Malware Detection in Network Traffic

This project develops an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for detecting malware in network traffic. It integrates data processing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation into a seamless workflow, using Apache Spark for data manipulation, scikit-learn and XGBoost for modeling, and MLFlow for tracking experiments and managing models. Hosted on AWS, the pipeline is designed for scalability and efficiency, targeting both benign and malicious traffic classification with a focus on optimizing model performance through hyperparameter tuning. The project's core is to provide a reliable, scalable solution for identifying malware in network traffic, enhancing cybersecurity measures.
